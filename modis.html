<h1 class="overview">Due to its dry, sunny, Mediterranean environment, 
    some of the greatest outdoor activities are possible there. Nevertheless, 
    the state also contains more than 2 million residences at high or extremely 
    high danger of wildfire destruction as a result of these natural elements and 
    the presence of human activity that follows. In California, wildfires scorched 
    more than 1.8 million acres in only one year. When a fire spreads to this size, 
    it not only poses a hazard to individuals at the point of ignition, but it also 
    has the potential to have far-reaching consequences miles away, as I personally 
    saw with the 2018 Camp Fire, California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire.
       
    The Bay Area saw a scarcity of the pollutant-blocking N95 masks as a result of the Bay
     Area experiencing heavy smoke from the northeastern region of the state. At most, as 
     it was for me, those impacted experienced two weeks of seclusion from the outside world; 
     yet, at its worst, it might have resulted in sad deaths, forced homelessness, and the 
     eradication of entire towns.</h1>
